## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps. The project is divided into three main components: `Backend-Pharmacy`, `Web-Pharmacy`, and `Mobile-Pharmacy`.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or Yarn package manager
*   Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pharmacy-location/pharmacy-location.git
cd pharmacy-location
```

### 2. Backend Setup (`Backend-Pharmacy`)

This directory contains the server-side logic and API.

```bash
cd Backend-Pharmacy
npm install # or yarn install
```

**Environment Configuration:**
Create a `.env` file in the `Backend-Pharmacy` directory and add necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).

```
# Example .env content
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=pharmacyuser
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=pharmacy_db
PORT=3000
```

**Run the Backend:**

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).

### 3. Web Application Setup (`Web-Pharmacy`)

This directory contains the web-based user interface.

```bash
cd ../Web-Pharmacy
npm install # or yarn install
```

**Run the Web Application:**

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

The web application will usually open in your browser at `http://localhost:3001` (or a similar port).

### 4. Mobile Application Setup (`Mobile-Pharmacy`)

This directory contains the mobile application (e.g., React Native).

```bash
cd ../Mobile-Pharmacy
npm install # or yarn install
```

**Run the Mobile Application:**

For Android:

```bash
npm run android # or yarn android
```

For iOS (requires macOS and Xcode):

```bash
npm run ios # or yarn ios
```

Ensure you have an emulator running or a physical device connected.
